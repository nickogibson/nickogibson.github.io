It has been a while since I updated this page.  
  
The game ## [Cosmic Storm](https://kudos.itch.io/cosmic-storm) is my latest live game.  
It was a fun little project to learn the Godot engine.  
Some new 3D objects on my [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/nickogibson). Not everything is a.i, I made the food items from scratch to practice.  
Text to 3D generation is getting pretty good, I'm using Meshy, but the main thing I need is clothing for my characters, which is still very tough to do.
