It has been a while since I updated this page.  
  
What's new recently? The game cosmic storm on kudos.itch.io is the latest live game.   
It was a fun little project to learn the Godot engine.  
Some new 3D objects on my sketchfab. Not everything is a.i, I made the food items from scratch to practice.  
Text to 3D generation is getting pretty good, I'm using Meshy, but the main thing I need, clothing for my characters, is still very tough to do.
