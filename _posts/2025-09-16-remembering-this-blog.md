It has been a while since I updated this page.  Trying something new with the theme.  

What I've been up to lately:  
  
## üëæ [Cosmic Storm](https://kudos.itch.io/cosmic-storm) is my latest game.  
It was a fun little project to learn the Godot engine.

I'm currently working on a much bigger project; A secret game world with unique procedural A.I features :D  
You'll have to join my discord for sneak peeks .

## üîâ The [SFX Mixer](https://nickogibson.github.io/SFX-Mixer/)?
A tool to generate sound effects that plays in the browser.  

Might be useful for someone making a browser game or interactive website.
