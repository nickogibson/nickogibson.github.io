### Let's hope not.
Happy new Year, and thanks for reading my blog!

Do people still blog? I guess I do. (And now robots do too.)

I've been playing with some of the A.I models lately. It can certainly help with creating graphics and textures for my games, and now text and more as well.
I share some of my AI stories and findings on this new blog [Synthetic Dawn](https://syntheticdawn.blogspot.com)
including links for Tools, Videos, and Stories.
I'm not an expert so please leave a comment if there's anything I missed :)

Some AI models can even write code. I use ChatGPT as an assistant, 
althought there are better models/tools for coding, such as OpenAI's Codex, and Github CoPilot. 

Also wrote an article here about [Making Games with A.I - TubeBlogger](https://tubeblogger.blogspot.com/2022/12/can-ai-make-video-games.html).
