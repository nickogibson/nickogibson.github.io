My next game is a Downhill Skating game. Race down the hill on a longboard. 
Learn powerslides to control your speed. And watch out for the A.I drivers!

## [A Game of Stonks](https://mverse.cloud) ![webgl](https://img.shields.io/badge/WebGL-blue?logo=webgl)

A strange office in a strange city. Use the computer to find out whats going on. Plays in browser. 
Was learning Unity WebGL & made this game for Mverse. The idea was you can print NFTs (for free:) and decorate the office with art. 
. Or just do the quest.

## [d20 Dice Roller on Github](https://nickogibson.github.io/apps/diceroller.html)

This was the first web app I made. Learned a lot of HTML and Javascript. Also made an Android version once to practice Android Studio.
For other simple web-apps, see my codepen in the sidebar ->
